This module supports playing the SCSP-generated music from most Sega Model 2A, 2B, 2C and 3 games.  Model 3 4-channel audio is downmixed to stereo.
Original Model 2 games using the Sega MultiPCM chips are not supported.  MPEG music is not supported.
<p>
MAME-style ROM image filenames are expected.  A game's ROM image set should be loaded either via ZIP archive, ideally with no extraneous files in the archive, or by
specifying the path of the sound program ROM image.
<p>
Output volume is adjusted on a per-game basis via an internal database.  Some games(e.g. "Virtua Fighter 3") also have per-song/composition volume adjustments as well.
